-- Getting started --

Dependencies:

 * libaio
 * libblkid
 * libkeyutils
 * liblz4
 * libscrypt
 * libsodium
 * liburcu
 * libuuid
 * libzstd
 * pkg-config
 * zlib1g
 * valgrind

On debian, you can install these with
    apt install -y pkg-config libaio-dev libblkid-dev libkeyutils-dev \
        liblz4-dev libscrypt-dev libsodium-dev liburcu-dev libzstd-dev \
        uuid-dev zlib1g-dev valgrind

Then, just make && make install


-- Experimental features --

Experimental fuse support is currently disabled by default. Fuse support is at
an early stage and may corrupt your filesystem, so it should only be used for
testing. To enable, you'll also need to add:

* libfuse3

On debian:
    apt install -y libfuse3-dev

Then, make using the BCACHEFS_FUSE environment variable:

BCACHEFS_FUSE=1 make &&


-- Tests --

Some tests are available to validate the "bcachefs" binary.  The tests depend
on python3 pytest.

On debian:
    apt install -u python3-pytest

Then, you can run the tests via:

    make check

Optionally, you may wish to run tests in parallel using python3-pytest-xdist:

    cd tests; pytest-3 -n4
